        <p>The Mothman is an urban legend, a winged humanoid creature first reported in Point Pleasant, West Virginia.</p>
        <p>What is the Mothman?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Urban legend originating from Point Pleasant, WV.</li>
            <li>Subject of a museum, statue, festival, themed foods, and tours in Point Pleasant.</li>
            <li>Iconic WV Legend that has spread across the USA and the internet</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This project uses the Mothman as a vehical to study cultural changes based on changes to the Mothman narrative.</p>
        <p>The history of Point Pleasant is tied to the Mothman, even though how tied it is depends on what Mothman you are looking at. The Mothman offers a window into how lasting legends are created and the purposes behind their changes.</p>

        <h2>Why is this research needed? - Background</h2>
        <p>There is value in urban legends, even if they are fake. The scary stories people tell are taken to adulthood, they are markers for identity. Monsters themselves are a sort of cultural body. How we interact with them and their narrative tells us about ourselves. For example, a changed narrative could signify change in culture, who is telling the story, or in what the legend is being used for. <br>Mothman tells us about culture and it is a vehicle for meaning. By examining a monster with such a varied description and stories behind it, we can develop an understanding of what The changes to the Mothman narrative, how the monster is perceived, suggest the people telling this story are changing. How people discuss the creature, even if it’s jokingly, informs us of how people see the world and themselves. Narratives of alien invaders blending in as neighbors, of prophetic but uncaring interlopers, of toxic waste and mutation, and of monstrous romance all tell us something about the Mothman. There is little scholarly work on the evolution of the Mothman narrative from a cultural perspective, but there are studies into the topic. Because of the ever changing nature of folk tales, there is always something new being added to the corpus of the Mothman, so even though previous projects exist, my project is able to explore different aspects of the narrative based on a different perspective in time.</p>
        
        <h2>Research Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>How did the Mothman legend begin? Why?</li>
            <li>How has the Mothman narrative changed over time? What has led to these changes?</li>
                <li>Is it the location? The time period? The people telling it?</li>
            <li>What is the purpose of the Mothman legend?</li>
                <li>Does it have one? Does it mean anything at all? Why does it matter?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Do You Study a Mothman? - Methodology</h2>
        <p>How do you study something intangible? How do you study a Mothman? My first outline for this project split it over several chunks of time in the summer, culminating in a trip to Point Pleasant, West Virginia and the West Virginia Archives and History Library. However, due to scheduling conflicts, I had to move my trip earlier in my project’s timeline.
