                <!--<h2>Why is this research needed? - Background</h2>
                <p>There is value in urban legends, even if they are fake. The scary stories people tell are taken to adulthood, they are markers for identity. Monsters themselves are a sort of cultural body. 
                    How we interact with them and their narrative tells us about ourselves. For example, a changed narrative could signify change in culture, who is telling the story, or in what the legend is being used for. 
                    <br>Mothman tells us about culture and it is a vehicle for meaning. By examining a monster with such a varied description and stories behind it, we can develop an understanding of what The changes to the Mothman narrative, 
                    how the monster is perceived, suggest the people telling this story are changing. How people discuss the creature, even if it’s jokingly, informs us of how people see the world and themselves. Narratives of alien invaders blending in as neighbors, 
                    of prophetic but uncaring interlopers, of toxic waste and mutation, and of monstrous romance all tell us something about the Mothman. There is little scholarly work on the evolution of the Mothman narrative from a cultural perspective, but there are studies into the topic. 
                    Because of the ever changing nature of folk tales, there is always something new being added to the corpus of the Mothman, so even though previous projects exist, my project is able to explore different aspects of the narrative based on a different perspective in time.</p>-->

                    <!--How do you study a Mothman? That was the first question I asked myself after setting up my research questions.
                    To study something intangible, you look to the stories that give it body.
                    Newspapers, movies, and spoken word are all examples of what gives a monster a 'cultural body.'
                    <br>-->
                    I focused on several key stages to building the corpus of the legend, which are described in detail later.
                    I examined the stories popularized in these stages, their impact, 
                    and possible cultural relevance. Below is how I went about gathering resources for my reserach, and how I assembled it at the end.
                    <!--<br> I broke my work up into six parts: the the initial 1966 sighting, Silver Bridge collapse, John Keel’s 1975 novel The Mothman Prophecies, its 2002 film adaptation, post-film Mothman tourism, and Mothman in media post-2002. </p>

                    as whenever I mentioned Mothman to someone familiar with the legend, they would hand me sources to look at. 
                    This led to an abundance of research, all of which I will not be able to show you today. However, be on the look out for future updates to this website!

                            Fears of the uncertainty of modern times and survilance play a larger role here.
                            <br>Further incorporates the bridge collapse into the narrative while removing the Men in Black.

                <!--<p>In John Keel’s The Mothman Prophecies, the Mothman was brought back into public consciousness, though it mainly appealed to conspiracy theorists. Keel’s Mothman was tied to other urban legends, specifically the Men in Black, Indrid Cold, UFOs, and prophetic visions. He connected the Mothman and thus all of Point Pleasant to a wider, global conspiracy, though it was still focused on Western, specifically American, perspectives. Fears of unknown invaders, hiding among the American people and replacing them in secret, of being controlled by unknown forces, of the future, of technology, of the media, and of the government are all present in this book. Keel’s work, although not as popular as the film adaptation of it, influenced the Mothman legend we know today. The notion of Mothman as an omen ties back to Keel’s connection to prophetic dreams and Christianity. Keel was not a West Virginian native himself, which colors his book and how he treated the town, making sure to idealize Point Pleasant as the classic American small town.
                    <br>The film The Mothman Prophecies (2002), starring Richard Gere, is the version that is most commonly referenced in modern Mothman lore. It takes from Keel’s book and adapts it to fit a more general American audience. Keel’s role is filled by two characters, the protagonist John Klein, reporter for the Washington Post, and the lore giving character Alexander Leek. Klein is more like the average audience, unaware of the supernatural and a New Yorker. The movie is part disaster, psychological horror, and suspense. It keeps the connection between Mothman and Indrid Cold, implying that Cold and Mothman are one and the same, and it keeps the themes of fear of technology and media, specifically the uncertainty of modern times. The fear of unknown callers, of being stalked, and of not being smart enough to understand warnings. </p

                <h3>The Mothman is about community.</h3>
                <p>From a cultural perspective, the Mothman is a community builder. It means different things to different people, 
                    much like how it looks different to different people, but it unites people under a shared concept nonetheless.
                     That is the beauty of the Mothman and what makes stories like it important. 
                    We bring the stories we are told in our childhood homes to adulthood, like markers of identity. 
                    For it to fragment so much is not necessarily bad. It means the story is migrating.
                     The Mothman legend is being told and retold for new audiences, with new perspectives to view it from.
                     It's expected for the story to fragment and evolve as it migrates. In fact, it's even
                     more expected from a legend like the Mothman which was so vauge to begin with,
                     you could create whatever monster you wanted from it based on the elements you liked best.
                    <!--The narrative of which was so vague to begin with that you could 
                    create whatever you wanted from it from the fragments you like best, and that is why Mothman is so popular.--> </p>

                    <p>American audiences wanted a mystery and a monster, and that's what the Mothman is. 
                    There's so much room for interpretation that the creature can be 
                    anything you want. It can serve any role society needs: a terrifying monster, a tourist attraction, a scapegoat, 
                    an allegory for communism, a dark prophet, or even the perfect boyfriend. The main identifying factors are its 
                    red eyes and dark wings, but it's easily recognizable to those who look for it. And if you are looking for it, 
                    you'll find Mothman everywhere. Any story of a dark figure with red eyes could be added to the mythos, and thus 
                    further fragment the narrative. At a glance, this array of meaning may make Mothman seem pointless, but that is 
                    why it matters. The purpose of Mothman is to be mysterious and relevant, to draw attention to and create mysteries 
                    within daily life. As time changes, the Mothman changes as well, which begs the question, what stories will we be 
                    telling in 20 years? Perhaps they will be the same monster stories, just rebooted to be more relevant.
