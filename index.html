        <h2>Why is this research needed? - Background</h2>
        <p>There is value in urban legends, even if they are fake. The scary stories people tell are taken to adulthood, they are markers for identity. Monsters themselves are a sort of cultural body. How we interact with them and their narrative tells us about ourselves. For example, a changed narrative could signify change in culture, who is telling the story, or in what the legend is being used for. <br>Mothman tells us about culture and it is a vehicle for meaning. By examining a monster with such a varied description and stories behind it, we can develop an understanding of what The changes to the Mothman narrative, how the monster is perceived, suggest the people telling this story are changing. How people discuss the creature, even if it’s jokingly, informs us of how people see the world and themselves. Narratives of alien invaders blending in as neighbors, of prophetic but uncaring interlopers, of toxic waste and mutation, and of monstrous romance all tell us something about the Mothman. There is little scholarly work on the evolution of the Mothman narrative from a cultural perspective, but there are studies into the topic. Because of the ever changing nature of folk tales, there is always something new being added to the corpus of the Mothman, so even though previous projects exist, my project is able to explore different aspects of the narrative based on a different perspective in time.</p>
        
        <h2>How Do You Study a Mothman? - Methodology</h2>
        <p>How do you study something intangible? How do you study a Mothman? My first outline for this project split it over several chunks of time in the summer, culminating in a trip to Point Pleasant, West Virginia and the West Virginia Archives and History Library. However, due to scheduling conflicts, I had to move my trip earlier in my project’s timeline.
