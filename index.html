       <h2>What is the Mothman?</h2>
        <p>The Mothman is an urban legend, a winged humanoid creature first reported in Point Pleasant, West Virginia.</p>
        
        <h3>Main Point: The Mothman  narrative has many different uses and purposes, and one of the most significant uses is to build community.</h2>

        <h2>Why is this research needed? - Background</h2>
        <p>There is value in urban legends, even if they are fake. The scary stories people tell are taken to adulthood, they are markers for identity. Monsters themselves are a sort of cultural body. How we interact with them and their narrative tells us about ourselves. For example, a changed narrative could signify change in culture, who is telling the story, or in what the legend is being used for. <br>Mothman tells us about culture and it is a vehicle for meaning. By examining a monster with such a varied description and stories behind it, we can develop an understanding of what The changes to the Mothman narrative, how the monster is perceived, suggest the people telling this story are changing. How people discuss the creature, even if itâ€™s jokingly, informs us of how people see the world and themselves. Narratives of alien invaders blending in as neighbors, of prophetic but uncaring interlopers, of toxic waste and mutation, and of monstrous romance all tell us something about the Mothman. There is little scholarly work on the evolution of the Mothman narrative from a cultural perspective, but there are studies into the topic. Because of the ever changing nature of folk tales, there is always something new being added to the corpus of the Mothman, so even though previous projects exist, my project is able to explore different aspects of the narrative based on a different perspective in time.</p>
