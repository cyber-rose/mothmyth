                <p>The Mothman is an urban legend with many forms, first reported in Point Pleasant, West Virginia.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Urban legend originating from Point Pleasant, WV.</li>
                    <li>Subject of a museum, statue, festival, themed foods, and tours in Point Pleasant.</li>
                    <li>Iconic WV Legend that has spread across the USA and the internet</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This project uses the Mothman as a vehical to study cultural changes based on changes to the Mothman narrative.</p>
                <p>The history of Point Pleasant is tied to the Mothman, even though how tied it is depends on what Mothman you are looking at. The Mothman offers a window into how lasting legends are created and the purposes behind their changes.</p>

                <!--Maybe make the below a drop down part? so that way, even after presenting, people can see it-->
                <h2>Why is this research needed? - Background</h2>
                <p>There is value in urban legends, even if they are fake. The scary stories people tell are taken to adulthood, they are markers for identity. Monsters themselves are a sort of cultural body. How we interact with them and their narrative tells us about ourselves. For example, a changed narrative could signify change in culture, who is telling the story, or in what the legend is being used for. <br>Mothman tells us about culture and it is a vehicle for meaning. By examining a monster with such a varied description and stories behind it, we can develop an understanding of what The changes to the Mothman narrative, how the monster is perceived, suggest the people telling this story are changing. How people discuss the creature, even if it’s jokingly, informs us of how people see the world and themselves. Narratives of alien invaders blending in as neighbors, of prophetic but uncaring interlopers, of toxic waste and mutation, and of monstrous romance all tell us something about the Mothman. There is little scholarly work on the evolution of the Mothman narrative from a cultural perspective, but there are studies into the topic. Because of the ever changing nature of folk tales, there is always something new being added to the corpus of the Mothman, so even though previous projects exist, my project is able to explore different aspects of the narrative based on a different perspective in time.</p>

                <h2>How Do You Study a Mothman? - Methodology</h2>

                <!--maybe put a image gallery in here if you have time-->

                <p>How do you study a Mothman? That was the first question I asked myself after setting up my research questions. My first outline for this project split it over several chunks of time in the summer, culminating in a trip to Point Pleasant, West Virginia and the West Virginia Archives and History Library. However, due to scheduling conflicts, I had to move my trip earlier in my project’s timeline.
                    <br> I broke my work up into six parts, which make up the timeline seen below. I examined the stories popularized in these stages, their impact, and possible cultural relevance. To get research, I worked both in the field and remotely.

                <h2>What I Discovered - Results</h2>
                <p>At each stage of the timeline, the general perception of Mothman changed.</p>
                <!--gallery here with mothmen?-->
                
                <p>In John Keel’s The Mothman Prophecies, the Mothman was brought back into public consciousness, though it mainly appealed to conspiracy theorists. Keel’s Mothman was tied to other urban legends, specifically the Men in Black, Indrid Cold, UFOs, and prophetic visions. He connected the Mothman and thus all of Point Pleasant to a wider, global conspiracy, though it was still focused on Western, specifically American, perspectives. Fears of unknown invaders, hiding among the American people and replacing them in secret, of being controlled by unknown forces, of the future, of technology, of the media, and of the government are all present in this book. Keel’s work, although not as popular as the film adaptation of it, influenced the Mothman legend we know today. The notion of Mothman as an omen ties back to Keel’s connection to prophetic dreams and Christianity. Keel was not a West Virginian native himself, which colors his book and how he treated the town, making sure to idealize Point Pleasant as the classic American small town.
                    <br>The film The Mothman Prophecies (2002), starring Richard Gere, is the version that is most commonly referenced in modern Mothman lore. It takes from Keel’s book and adapts it to fit a more general American audience. Keel’s role is filled by two characters, the protagonist John Klein, reporter for the Washington Post, and the lore giving character Alexander Leek. Klein is more like the average audience, unaware of the supernatural and a New Yorker. The movie is part disaster, psychological horror, and suspense. It keeps the connection between Mothman and Indrid Cold, implying that Cold and Mothman are one and the same, and it keeps the themes of fear of technology and media, specifically the uncertainty of modern times. The fear of unknown callers, of being stalked, and of not being smart enough to understand warnings. </p>

                <h2>What the Mothman Means - Conclusion</h2>
                <p>From a cultural perspective, the Mothman is a community builder or at least a community tool. It can be a coping mechanism, a scape goat (especially for the omen thing), a mascot for the town, a queer icon, a tribute to the wierd and wild, and a relic to the past. It means different things to different people, much like how it looks different to different people. That is the beauty of the Mothman and what makes story’s like it important. We bring the stories we are told in our childhood homes to adulthood, it’s like a relic of our times. For it to fragment so much is not necessarily bad, but it shows a migrating story which you could argue is made possible thanks to the technology that some mothman story’s fear. We can exchange ideas across different areas with ease nowadays, which has spawned interesting stories and legends, but arguably those most vulnerable to fragmentation are those like the Mothman. The narrative of which was so vague to begin with that you could create whatever you wanted from it from the fragments you like best, and that is why Mothman is so popular. 
                    <br>American audiences wanted a mystery and a monster, and that’s what the Mothman is. The conflicting views of it are what makes its story so popular; there’s so much room for interpretation that the creature can be anything you want. It can serve any role society needs: a terrifying monster, a tourist attraction, a scapegoat, an allegory for communism, a dark prophet, or even the perfect boyfriend. The main identifying factors are its red eyes and dark wings, but it’s easily recognizable to those who look for it. And if you are looking for it, you’ll find Mothman everywhere. Any story of a dark figure with red eyes could be added to the mythos, and thus further fragment the narrative. At a glance, this array of meaning may make Mothman seem pointless, but that is why it matters. The purpose of Mothman is to be mysterious and relevant, to draw attention to and create mysteries within daily life. As time changes, the Mothman changes as well, which begs the question, what stories will we be telling in 20 years? Perhaps they will be the same monster stories, just rebooted to be more relevant.
