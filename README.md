# MothmanMonroeProject
Freshman year Monroe Project on the Mothman as an urban legend and how it relates to culture. This READ ME will change over time as a I finalize my project. Ideally, this will be the abstract for the project though slightly modified.

Wanted to try using a github pages default theme, but having trouble getting the theme to apply to my website. May try another method since this is being difficult
