                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>This website is the final product of a First-Year Monroe Scholar Research Project
                    conducted by Elena Ceravalo, mentored by Dr. Jay Watkins and funded by the College of William and Mary.
                    This project aims to study the meaning of the Mothman, not the existance of it, and how this meaning has changed over time.

                <h2>About the Author</h2>
                <h3>Elena Ceravalo</h3>
                <p>I'm an undergraduate student at William & Mary, class of 2025, and member of the Monroe Scholar Program. 
                    I plan to major in Computer Science and minor in Biology.
                    This project was inspired by my personal love of urban legends and the History 150 course
                    "Our Monsters, Our Selves," taught by Doctor Jay Watkins.

                <h2>Special Thanks</h2>
                <p>Thank you to the College of William & Mary, the Monroe Scholar Program, the Charles Center, and Dr. Jay Watkins for helping make this project possible.
                    Without your assistance, I wouldn't have been able to spend the time needed to make this a reality.
                    Thank you to my friends and family who listened to me talk endlessly about the Mothman and the significance of urban legends.
                    You didn't have to listen the whole time, but I appreciated it. Thanks to the archivists and historians at the West Virginia Cultural Center for helping with my research.
                    Also thank you to my Mothman Bus Tour guide for stopping the van to let me run out and take photos. Without you, there would be alot less images on this website.
                    Thank you to WildStar Publishing for the book. Thank you to everyone who made this project possible!
